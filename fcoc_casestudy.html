        <p>Non-profit organizations, especially smaller organizations, have a limited amount of operational funds and
            are often forced to make difficult choices about where they use those funds. A lot of the time, their
            website gets neglected. For this project we were asked to select a non-profit website and redesign one user
            path that would have the most impact on the organization.
        </p>
        <p>With my team we looked for a small, local organization and found Friendship Circle of Colorado. They serve
            kids with special needs by arranging social events with peers to promote friendship and community. The
            current website is dated with broken links, obscured images, and confusing navigation.
        </p>

    <section class="fcocResearch" id="fcocResearch">

            </h2>
        </div>
        <p>To start our project, we were able to interview the Program Director of FCOC. She let us know that they are
            aware the website needs updating. They would like the website to have a better flow and allow users to
            easily connect with the organization. FCOC would like visitors to their site to feel in the loop and drawn
            to get involved.
        </p>
        <p>After speaking with the FCOC, we wanted to get a feel for what a user actually did and found while they
            visited the website. We created a persona to help us get an idea what a user may be doing on the FCOC
            website.
        </p>
        <img src="./Assets/FCOC_ProtoPersona.png" alt="Details about a woman with a son who has special needs">
        <p>We looked at the website from the point of view of a mother concerned about her son's social health. Her
            concerns are compounded by her son's special needs which make it hard for him to feel included at social
            activities. With this persona in mind, we decided to conduct user tests to see what pain points visitors to
            the site experience. We asked users to navigate the site, find an event and RSVP, find volunteer
            opportunities and tell us their thoughts at each step of the process.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="fcocDefinition" id="fcocDef">

            </h2>
        </div>
        <p>The initial user interviews for this project were some of the most interesting I've taken part in. With each
            interview we learned something new about the site and how users were navigating it.
        </p>
        <p>We used affinity diagramming to analyze our results. The affinity diagram showed some of the following
            findings:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Navigation is confusing and unclear</li>
            <li>It is unclear how to RSVP for an event (or that an RSVP is needed)
            </li>
            <li>The volunteer sign up form is intimidating with broken portions and no way to specify volunteer
                preferences (such as schedule)
            </li>
            <li>The overall appearance is outdated and inconsistent</li>
            <li>There are multiple broken links throughout the site</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="./Assets/FCOC_AffinityDiagram.png" alt="Sticky notes sorted by category">
        <p>From these results we determined that the navigation, events page, and overall aesthetics are blockers for
            users and that we might be able to help the FCOC if we thoughtfully redesigned these aspects of the site.
            The final problem statement we developed was “How might we improve friendshipcirclecolorado.com to be more
            compelling and effortless to use shown by an increase in overall participation?”</p>

                        pointed out that the icons currently being used were misleading. </p>
                    <p>We used card sorting to create 4 new categories for the navigation - About Us, Programs, Get

                        We created the user flow below for the process.</p>

        <p>Early in the process we received feedback that having a donate button on each event was out of place, so we
            eliminated that button.
        </p>
        <p>Once we had some sketches we moved on to mid-fidelity versions. We created a prototype and conducted
            usability testing. We asked the users to RSVP for an event, find where volunteer information would be
            located, and find the mission of the organization. This allowed us to test the RSVP flow and the navigation.
        </p>
        <p>We found there was some confusion with the RSVP form. Adding additional children to the form was unclear. We
            revised this - creating a dedicated button to add more children to the RSVP.
        </p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row formRevision">

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The buttons on the RSVP confirmation page were also confusing users. They reported that “Return to Event
            Page” and “More Events” were too similar and they weren’t sure what to expect when they clicked either. To
            solve this, we removed the “Return to Event Page” but added a link that allowed the user to return to the
            event details if they desired. We also added an “Add to Calendar” option after several users asked for it.
        </p>
        <div class="container">

        </div>
        <h4 class="font2 prototypeSubtitle">Hi-Fidelity</h4>
        <p>After we made the changes above, we created a style guide and added style to all our pages and completed a
            high-fidelity prototype. We were asked by the FCOC to keep the white, teal, and purple. We wanted to keep
            the site fun and welcoming so we added pink and orange to create some contrast and interest.</p>

        <p>One of the most beneficial parts of this project was learning to work within constraints provided by the
            FCOC. The Program Manager was very generous in answering our questions and also let us know they would want
            certain things to be included or maintained in our design. This included wording in the RSVP confirmation
            and overall color scheme among other things. Creating a design that worked well for the user within this
            frame was a challenge, but also rewarding.</p>

        <p>For this project a teammate and I were tasked with choosing a U.S. government website that needed redesign
            then completing that redesign. We chose the Department of the Interior (DOI) because their broad mission to
            protect the country's resources and manage relationships with native communities needs buy-in from U.S.
            residents. But, the current website does not serve their mission.
        </p>
        <p>I worked with a partner to conduct research and evaluate areas of improvement on the current DOI website. We
            then worked separately to complete our own redesign of one user path on the site.

        <p>To start this project we got familiar with the DOI website then developed a proto-persona to help us
            hypothesize what a person visiting the doi.gov may need and hope to find.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/DOI_protopersona.png" alt="Drawing of a person in a red sweatshirt">
        <p>With that persona in mind we looked at the typical path they might follow and determined what areas we most
            wanted to test with users. Through our initial usability testing we wanted to find out how users were able
            to find information on the site. We asked them to find how to volunteer for the DOI and to sign up for the
            email list.</p>
        <p>
            We also conducted a second set of testing specifically on the overall navigation of the site. These users
            were asked to use the current navigation to find information on the DOI policies on the climate crisis,
            locate the DOI blog, and find the media contact for the department so that we could evaluate the layout of
            the navigation.

                    <li>Though the DOI clearly values their volunteer involvement as shown in the header on their About
                        page,
                        there is a lack of concrete information about actually volunteering on the site.

                    <li>What volunteer information does exist is presented in a boring and uninspiring manner.

                    <li>The process to sign up for the DOI email list is overly long and confusing. There are many pages
                        without
                        any status of where the user is in the process. Some pages include asking the user to sign up
                        for
                        other
                        government email lists that have nothing to do with DOI.

                    <li>The user is asked to create a password in order to manage their email subscription, but there is
                        no
                        place on the website to login to do so.</li>

                        to
                        find. All users had to look in multiple locations before they found it.

                    <li>Media contact information for the DOI was difficult to locate. Again, no users were able to find

                        easily.

                several
                sections of the navigation are misleading or poorly placed. Individually, I created a new sitemap and

                belonged
                in
                the news section. With split results, I decided to put it in the news section because the articles
                on
                the
                blog are updated frequently and most resemble news articles rather than social media posts.</p>

            <p>In addition to the navigation, I chose to focus on the volunteer path for this redesign. The DOI has
                280,000
                volunteers and clearly values them. Improving this path is most likely to engage users and get them
                excited
                about the mission of the DOI.
            </p>
            <p>I created wireframes for the homepage and the volunteer path. I wanted the main focus of the homepage to
                be a
                hero header with a photo of a beautiful natural scene in the US to reflect the mission of the DOI. I
                used
                cards to display information and news that is important to the DOI below the fold.

            <p>Based on feedback, I re-organized the layout of the homepage to have the Explore the DOI section above
                the
                News in order to more prominently feature those important items. I also included a direct link to the
                DOI
                blog on the homepage to help users find it quickly. Feedback also showed that the footer looked slightly
                disorganized. I rearranged the spacing to make it more readable.
            </p>
            <p>I initially designed the volunteer page to have a z-layout to draw the user's eye down the page. However,
                the
                volunteer page needed more details on the process to actually volunteer with the DOI that best fit in a
                large header. I adjusted the layout and added a simple animation to make the process clear to the user.

                <p>I created a detailed UI style guide for the redesign that included information on

                </p>
                <p>I conducted a series of 5-second tests on the initial high fidelity mockup of the homepage to get a
                    feel
                    of what immediate impression the site left with a user. I asked each user to look at it for 5-10
                    seconds
                    then
                    asked them to tell me how they would describe the site, what they think is the purpose of the site,
                    who
                    it
                    is designed for, and their overall impression of the layout.

                <p>Overall, the users' impression was positive. They noticed and recalled the photo in the

                    Two
                    testers noted that they appreciated the navbar was prominent at the top. Two also noted that it was

                    organized with everything in its own spot.
                </p>
                <p>After this testing was completed, I proceeded to apply the style to all wireframes and create a

        <p>I conducted user testing on the high-fidelity prototype to see how users navigated the redesign and what

            blog.</p>

        <p>I tested users on both desktop and mobile. 87% of tasks were completed, with the user expected location of
            the DOI blog still split. Though it sometimes wasn't in the first location a user checked, all users were
            able to find the blog without frustration, so I did not move the blog in the navigation.</p>
        <p>Based on user comments, I adjusted spacing on the icons in the global header and added titles on the
            volunteer testimonial page to make the page easier to scan.

        <p>Some general takeaways from this project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A thorough UI style guide makes the design process smoother.</li>
            <li>Animations and transitions make a prototype and website feel more real and interesting.
            </li>
            <li>Designing an interesting layout on mobile can be a challenge, so it is best to start with that screen
                size, keeping the transition to computer in mind.</li>
            <li>People often don't scroll through a page to find something, so it is crucial to have a well organized
                navigation.</li>
        </ul>
